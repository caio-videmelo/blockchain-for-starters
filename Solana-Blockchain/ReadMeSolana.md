### How to Use:
To use this contract, you can use tools like Remix to compile and deploy the contract on Ethereum. 
Here are the basic steps:
  1. **Copy the Solidity code**: Paste the above code into a new file in Remix with a .sol extension;
  2. **Compile the contract**: Use the Solidity compiler to compile the contract;
  3. **Deploy the contract**: Use the execution environment in Remix to deploy the contract on the Ethereum test network;
After deploying the contract, you can interact with it by calling the `addBlock` function to add new blocks and the `getBlock`
or `getBlockchain` functions to view existing blocks.
